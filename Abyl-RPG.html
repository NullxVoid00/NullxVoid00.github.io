                    <h3>Design Your Own Abilities:</h3>
                    <p>Our example skills give you a complete game out of the box, but they're just templates! Every ability can be customized or replaced entirely:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Warriors</strong> start with basic Slash but eventually unleash Berserk mode - or whatever ultimate ability YOU create!</li>
                        <li><strong>Mages</strong> begin throwing Fireballs but could graduate to summoning creatures, manipulating time, or wielding YOUR unique magic system!</li>
                        <li><strong>Rogues</strong> evolve from simple Backstabs - maybe yours throw shurikens, set traps, or use gadgets you design!</li>
                        <li><strong>Clerics</strong> progress from basic healing - but could channel nature magic, dark arts, or divine powers you imagine!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The skill system is completely open! Change damage formulas, add new target types, create combo systems, or invent entirely new mechanics. Every parameter is exposed and documented. Your imagination is the only limit!</p>

                    <h3>Combat That Keeps You Thinking:</h3>
                    <p>Forget mindless button mashing! Every turn is a tactical decision that could mean victory or defeat. Do you go all-out attack? Play it safe with defend? Use that precious MP for a game-changing spell? The choice is yours!</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Phase-Based Strategy</strong> - Players act together, then enemies retaliate. Coordinate with your party to focus fire on dangerous foes or spread damage strategically!</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed Matters</strong> - Faster characters act first in each phase. Build a speedy Rogue to always get the jump on enemies, or accept the Warrior's slower speed for their incredible durability!</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk vs Reward</strong> - Defending cuts damage in half but costs your turn. Time it right to survive devastating boss attacks!</li>
                        <li><strong>Critical Hits</strong> - That satisfying moment when you land a critical strike! Boost your Luck stat to see those beautiful damage multipliers more often!</li>
                        <li><strong>MP Management</strong> - Powerful abilities drain your MP. Spam them early and you'll be stuck with basic attacks when you need them most!</li>

                    <p>When danger strikes, you're instantly transported to the battle arena! No loading screens, no waiting - just pure adrenaline as you and your party face off against fearsome foes. The action menu appears right where you need it in VR, letting you make split-second decisions. Watch your attacks connect with satisfying visual effects, see damage numbers pop up, and feel the rush when "VICTORY!" flashes across your screen!</p>
                    
                    <p>Every battle ends with rewards - experience to grow stronger and gold to... well, that's for YOU to decide! Add shops, crafting, or any reward system you imagine! The real reward? The stories you'll tell about that time your custom Necromancer class saved everyone by summoning an undead army!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pump ATK</strong> to become a damage-dealing monster. Watch enemies' health bars melt!</li>
                        <li><strong>Boost DEF</strong> to laugh off attacks that would flatten others. Become the immovable object!</li>
                        <li><strong>Increase SPD</strong> to always act first. Strike before enemies even know what hit them!</li>
                        <li><strong>Raise INT</strong> for devastating magical damage. Make your spells the stuff of legends!</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Want a glass cannon Mage with maxed INT but paper-thin defense? Do it! Prefer a speedy Warrior who breaks the mold? That's your choice! Create entirely new stats, add skill trees, or design unique progression systems. There's no "wrong" way to build - only YOUR way!</p>

            <h2>TARGETING SYSTEM</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <div class="feature-text">
                    <h3>Intuitive Targeting That Just Works:</h3>
                    <p>In the heat of battle, the last thing you want is fumbling with confusing controls! Our targeting system is designed to be instantly understandable while offering deep tactical options!</p>
                    
                    <h3>Every Action Has Its Target:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Single Enemy</strong> - Pick your victim! Perfect for focusing down the biggest threat or finishing off weakened foes!</li>
                        <li><strong>All Enemies</strong> - Why choose? Unleash devastating AoE attacks that hit everything! Watch the entire enemy party's HP bars drop!</li>
                        <li><strong>Single Ally</strong> - Be the hero your party needs! Target specific allies for healing, buffs, or revival!</li>
                        <li><strong>All Allies</strong> - Spread the love! Party-wide heals and buffs can turn the tide of battle!</li>
                        <li><strong>Self Target</strong> - Sometimes you need to help yourself first. Self-buffs and healing keep you in the fight!</li>
                        <li><strong>Random Target</strong> - Let fate decide! Some abilities pick targets randomly for that extra bit of chaos!</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Visual Clarity in VR:</h3>
                    <p>We know VR can be disorienting, so we made targeting crystal clear:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Glowing Indicators</strong> - Valid targets light up with clear visual markers. No guessing who you can hit!</li>
                        <li><strong>Color Coding</strong> - Different colors for different target types. Red for enemies, green for allies - simple and effective!</li>
                        <li><strong>Preview Effects</strong> - See exactly what your AoE spell will hit BEFORE you cast it. No wasteful misses!</li>
                        <li><strong>Audio Feedback</strong> - Satisfying sounds confirm your selection. You'll KNOW when you've locked onto your target!</li>
                        <li><strong>Smart Auto-Targeting</strong> - For AoE and self-targeted abilities, the system handles targeting automatically. Just choose the skill and watch it work!</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The best interface is invisible - and that's what we've achieved! Targeting feels so natural, you'll forget it's even there. Just point, click, and unleash devastation!</p>

                    <h3>Status Effects Add Strategic Depth:</h3>
                    <p>Combat isn't just about damage numbers - it's about controlling the battlefield! Status effects transform simple battles into chess matches where every move matters!</p>
                    
                    <h3>Afflictions That Change Everything:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>💀 Poison</strong> - Watch enemies slowly wither away! That tough boss becomes manageable when it's losing HP every turn!</li>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Stun</strong> - The ultimate shutdown! Stunned enemies skip their turn entirely. Time it right to prevent devastating attacks!</li>
                        <li><strong>😴 Sleep</strong> - Peaceful but deadly! Sleeping foes skip turns until damaged. Perfect for divide-and-conquer strategies!</li>
                        <li><strong>👁️ Blind</strong> - Can't hit what you can't see! Blinded enemies miss more often, neutralizing physical powerhouses!</li>
                        <li><strong>🤐 Silence</strong> - Shut down those pesky spellcasters! No magic means no problems!</li>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Paralysis</strong> - The gambler's curse! Paralyzed enemies MIGHT act, or might waste their turn. Keep them guessing!</li>
                        <li><strong>⬆️ Stat Buffs</strong> - Temporary power boosts! Turn your Warrior into an unstoppable force or your Mage into a nuclear bomb!</li>
                        <li><strong>⬇️ Stat Debuffs</strong> - Weaken foes before the killing blow! Lower their defense, then strike for massive damage!</li>
                        <li><strong>🎨 Your Effects</strong> - Create custom status effects! Time stops, gravity reversal, charm, fear - if you can imagine it, you can build it!</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Strategic Status Gameplay:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Duration Management</strong> - Effects last multiple turns, so timing is crucial. Apply poison early for maximum damage over time!</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual Indicators</strong> - Can't miss who's affected! Clear icons show active effects at a glance!</li>
                        <li><strong>Stacking Strategies</strong> - Some effects stack for increased power! Multiple poisons mean multiple damage ticks!</li>
                        <li><strong>Cleanse and Counter</strong> - Clerics can remove negative effects, making them invaluable against status-heavy enemies!</li>
                        <li><strong>Resistance Systems</strong> - Higher stats provide natural resistance. That high-INT Mage might shrug off silence!</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Master the status effect system and you'll find battles have layers of strategy you never imagined. That impossible boss? Maybe it just needs a good stunning! Better yet - create your own unique status effects that change how YOUR game plays!</p>
